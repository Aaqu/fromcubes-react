> **⚠️ Alpha Module** — This project is in early development. Expect breaking changes. Test on a clean Node-RED instance.

A Node-RED node that turns any `/fromcubes/<sub-path>` URL into a React page. Write JSX in the editor, deploy, open the URL — your component talks to the flow over WebSocket. No build step, no browser compiler. All portal pages are served under the hardcoded `/fromcubes/` prefix so every node cleanly coexists under one URL tree.

For internals, plugin authoring, and the deploy pipeline see [README-DEV.md](./README-DEV.md).

## Prerequisites

- **Node-RED ≥ 4.0** — declared in `package.json`'s `node-red.version` and
  enforced by the editor's Palette Manager.
- **Node.js ≥ 18.5** — Node-RED 4.x's effective minimum.
- **npm** — only required when you use the `libs` config field to install
  user packages at deploy time. The portal itself does not need `npm`
  available at runtime.
- A WebSocket-capable reverse proxy or direct connection — the portal
  upgrades `/fromcubes/<sub-path>/_ws`. If you front Node-RED with nginx /
  Traefik / Caddy, enable `Upgrade: websocket` headers on that path.

## Install

```bash
cd ~/.node-red
npm install @aaqu/fromcubes-portal-react@alpha
# restart Node-RED
```

That's it. No build step. Any npm packages you list in the node config (e.g. `d3, three`) are installed automatically on deploy.

## Your first portal

1. Drop a **portal-react** node onto a flow.
2. Set **Sub-path** to e.g. `hello` (the node will serve at `/fromcubes/hello`; the `/fromcubes/` prefix is fixed).
3. Open the code editor and paste:
   ```jsx
   function App() {
     const { data, send } = useNodeRed();
     return (
       <div className="p-4">
         <p>From flow: {JSON.stringify(data)}</p>
         <button
           className="px-3 py-1 bg-blue-500 text-white rounded"
           onClick={() => send({ clicked: Date.now() })}
         >
           click me
         </button>
       </div>
     );
   }
   ```
4. Deploy. Open `http://localhost:1880/fromcubes/hello`.
5. Wire an **inject** node into the portal-react input → see `data` update live. Wire its output → see button clicks arrive in your flow.

## The `useNodeRed()` hook

Everything your component needs from the flow lives in one hook:

```jsx
const {
  data,          // last broadcast msg.payload from input wire (reactive)
  send,          // send(payload, topic?) — emit msg on output wire
  user,          // portal user object (when Portal Auth is enabled), or null
  portalClient,  // unique session/tab ID assigned by server on connect
  authRequired,  // true when this session is anonymous on an authenticated-only portal
} = useNodeRed();
```

### Initial data on connect

The server does **not** cache payloads — a freshly-loaded page has `data === null` until the flow pushes the next message. For periodic streams that's at most one interval of blankness. For event-driven or per-user data, request the initial state from the component:

```jsx
const { data, send } = useNodeRed();
useEffect(() => { send({}, "init"); }, []);
```

In the flow, catch `topic === "init"`, look up the state (per-user via `msg._client.userId` if needed) and reply — `msg._client` is already set on the inbound message, so the response returns as a unicast to exactly that tab.

## Node configuration

| Field | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Sub-path | Part after `/fromcubes/`, e.g. `page1` → served at `/fromcubes/page1`. Required. Nesting allowed (`team/alpha`). Reserved: `public`, `_ws`. |
| Page Title | Browser tab title |
| npm Packages | Comma-separated, e.g. `d3, three, @react-three/fiber` |
| Portal Auth | Enable portal user header extraction (see Multi-user) |
| Authenticated-only delivery | Untargeted msgs (no `msg._client`) go only to sessions with portal identity headers; anonymous sessions get an `auth_required` frame on connect (see Multi-user). Off by default. |
| Show WS status | Small "fromcubes • connected/disconnected" badge in the page's bottom-right corner (off by default) |
| Head HTML | Extra trusted-author `<head>` tags (CDN, fonts, CSS, scripts). Runs in the public portal page. |
| Code Editor | Monaco with JSX — must define `<App />` |

There is also a config node, **fc-portal-component**, that lets you define reusable React components once and reference them by name from any portal-react node. Referenced components (and their transitive dependencies) are injected at transpile time, so unused ones add nothing to the bundle.

For shared **non-component** code (helpers, custom hooks, constants), use **fc-portal-utility** — a sibling config node. Unlike component nodes (which export exactly one symbol via an IIFE wrapper), a utility node is injected raw at top level so it can declare any number of `function` / `const` / `let` / `class` symbols. Selective inclusion: a utility node lands in a portal's bundle only when the portal's JSX or any of its referenced library components mentions at least one of the symbols declared in that utility.

```jsx
// fc-portal-utility, Module name = mathHelpers
const PI2 = Math.PI * 2;
function clamp(n, min, max) { return Math.max(min, Math.min(max, n)); }
function useDebounce(value, ms = 300) {
  const [v, setV] = React.useState(value);
  React.useEffect(() => {
    const t = setTimeout(() => setV(value), ms);
    return () => clearTimeout(t);
  }, [value, ms]);
  return v;
}

// portal-react, JSX tab
function App() {
  const { data } = useNodeRed();
  const slow = useDebounce(data?.value);
  return <div>{clamp(slow ?? 0, 0, 100)}</div>;
}
```

## Editor features

- **Monaco** with full JSX support and `useNodeRed()` type declarations
- **Tailwind CSS autocompletion** inside `className="..."` (~19k utility classes). Classes must be complete literals in a string — dynamic `bg-${tone}-500` generates no CSS (use a map of full classes). Arbitrary values incl. `w-[calc(100%-2rem)]`, `grid-cols-[repeat(2,1fr)]`, `mt-0!` and `@md:flex` are supported.
- **JSX tag completion** — type tag name, Tab to expand
- **Self-close collapse** — type `/` inside empty `<tag></tag>` to convert to `<tag />`
- **Ctrl+D / Cmd+D** — duplicate the current line or selection (in every Monaco editor of the package)
- **Ctrl+/ / Cmd+/** — JSX-aware comment toggle. Style follows the first selected line (VS Code behavior): selecting a whole `return ( … )` block gives plain `//` on every line, while lines between live JSX tags are wrapped in `{/* … */}` (a plain `//` there is literal text — JSX renders it on the page)
- **Component completion** — registry components + any PascalCase word
- **Utility-symbol completion** — top-level identifiers from any `fc-portal-utility` node, suggested in JS context
- **Components / Utilities dialogs** — buttons in the JSX tab; Components inserts `<Tag></Tag>`, Utilities expands to the symbols declared in each node and inserts the bare identifier on click
- **Portal Assets sidebar** — file manager for static assets (GLB, textures, fonts…)

## Multi-user / Multi-tenancy

Portal-react has four routing modes — broadcast, auth-cast (every authenticated session), user-cast (every tab of one user), and unicast (one specific tab). Everything works without authentication too — user-cast and auth-cast just degrade gracefully when there is no user.

### Identity

| Identifier | Scope | Persistence | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| `portalClient` | Single WS session (one tab) | Lost on reconnect — server assigns a new UUID | Generated server-side on connect |
| `userId` / `username` | All sessions of a user | Survives reconnect and new tabs | `x-portal-user-*` headers (when **Portal Auth** is enabled) |

**Portal Auth header contract** — injected by an upstream reverse proxy such as `aaqu-portal-auth`:

| Header | Field |
|---|---|
| `x-portal-user-id` | `userId` |
| `x-portal-user-name` | `userName` |
| `x-portal-user-username` | `username` |
| `x-portal-user-email` | `email` |
| `x-portal-user-role` | `role` |
| `x-portal-user-groups` | `groups` (JSON array) |

If Portal Auth is disabled or headers are absent, `user` is `null` and user-scoped features are silently skipped — broadcast and per-session features still work.

### Routing modes

Every inbound `msg` arrives in your flow with `msg._client` already filled in by the server. The flow then decides where the response should go by setting (or clearing) `msg._client` on the outgoing `msg`:

```javascript
// BROADCAST — everyone connected to this endpoint
delete msg._client;
return msg;

// UNICAST — only the tab that sent the original msg (echo)
// Keep msg._client as-is; it already carries portalClient.
return msg;

// UNICAST — a specific tab whose ID you know
msg._client = { portalClient: "a1b2c3d4-..." };
return msg;

// USER-CAST — every tab of a specific user (even ones that just opened)
msg._client = { userId: "alice" };
return msg;

// AUTH-CAST — every session that arrived with x-portal-user-* identity;
// anonymous sessions (no proxy headers) are skipped
msg._client = { authenticated: true };
return msg;
```

**Auth-cast vs broadcast.** Broadcast reaches every connected client, including anonymous ones. Auth-cast reaches only sessions that arrived with `x-portal-user-*` identity headers. Use auth-cast for data that any logged-in user may see; use broadcast only for data that is genuinely public. Nothing is cached server-side — each mode delivers to the clients connected at send time.

### Authenticated-only delivery (fail-safe default)

With the **Authenticated-only delivery** checkbox enabled on the node, an untargeted `msg` (no `msg._client`) is delivered as an **auth-cast** instead of a broadcast — a forgotten `_client` then narrows delivery to logged-in sessions rather than leaking to anonymous ones. A true broadcast stays available explicitly:

```javascript
msg._client = { authenticated: false };  // deliberate broadcast, anonymous included
return msg;
```

Anonymous sessions are told up front: right after `hello` the server sends a single `auth_required` frame (once per connection — never per skipped message, so unauthenticated clients learn nothing about traffic volume or timing). The hook exposes it so the page can render a login hint instead of staying silently empty:

```jsx
const { data, authRequired } = useNodeRed();
if (authRequired) return <p className="p-4 text-zinc-500">Log in to see this data.</p>;
```

**Anti-spoof guarantee.** On every inbound message the server overwrites `msg._client` from scratch using the socket's own `portalClient` and the user data captured at connect. A browser cannot forge `_client` — whatever it puts there is discarded.

**User-cast uses an O(1) index** so a message to `{userId: "alice"}` reaches every tab of Alice with a single lookup, not a scan.

### Without a user (anonymous mode)

If **Portal Auth** is off (or no proxy headers arrive), everything still works:

- `broadcast` and `portalClient` unicast: unchanged
- `user`-cast: gracefully skipped (no `userId` to target)
- `auth`-cast: delivers to nobody (no session has identity headers)
- `useNodeRed().user` is `null`

Same model as dashboard 2 — no auth required to use the node.

## Portal Assets

Static files (3D models, textures, fonts, etc.) can be uploaded and served from a public endpoint.

- Open the **Portal Assets** tab in the Node-RED sidebar
- Upload files via button or drag & drop
- Organize in folders (create, rename, move between folders)
- Copy public path with one click — use in JSX: `/fromcubes/public/models/scene.glb`
- Download and delete files from the context menu

All uploads require Node-RED admin authentication. Files are served publicly at `/fromcubes/public/`.

Limits: 100 MB per file, 500 MB total, 1000 files max.

## Examples

Available via **Menu → Import → Examples → @aaqu/fromcubes-portal-react**.
Each flow includes a comment node with what to expect and the URL to open.

Import **Shared Components** first — it provides the UI building blocks (Page, Header, Stat, Button, ValueBadge) referenced by the others.

| Example | npm packages | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Shared Components** | — | Reusable components: Page, Header, Stat, Button, ValueBadge |
| **Sensor Portal** | — | Sensor gauge with live WebSocket data |
| **Live Chart** | `chart.js/auto` | Live updating Chart.js charts |
| **D3 Poland Map** | `d3` | Interactive SVG map of Poland (simulated data) |
| **Three.js Scene** | `three`, `@react-three/fiber`, `@react-three/drei` | 3D scene with Three.js |
| **PixiJS Sprites** | `pixi.js`, `@pixi/react` | Clickable bunny sprites with PixiJS |
| **WebGPU Shader** | `three` | WebGPU renderer + TSL animated shaders |
| **Utility Hooks** | — | `fc-portal-utility` demo: `useDebounce` custom hook + `clamp` helper |

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause |
|---|---|
| Red status "transpile error" + error page on the endpoint | JSX syntax error — fix code, redeploy (cache invalidates automatically) |
| Red status "legacy endpoint" on deploy | Flow was saved before the `/fromcubes/` prefix became hardcoded. Open the node, set **Sub-path**, redeploy. Automatic migration is disabled to avoid silent URL changes. |
| Red status "bad sub-path" | Sub-path is empty or violates the rules (no leading `/`, no whitespace, no `..`, segments must start alphanumerically, `public`/`_ws` reserved). |
| Yellow status "css-fail" | Tailwind generation failed (usually an invalid class in JSX). Page still loads but unstyled. Fix the class, redeploy — the status clears on the next successful build. |
| Code editor stays blank / `portal-react/vs/loader.js` 404s | Monaco is served live from the package's own `node_modules` at `/portal-react/vs` (no postinstall copy step). The 404 means `RED.httpAdmin` is mounted under a non-root `httpAdminRoot` the editor didn't account for, or `monaco-editor` failed to install. Reinstall the package and hard-refresh the editor (`Cmd/Ctrl-Shift-R`). |
| `npm install @aaqu/fromcubes-portal-react` ends with `EACCES` | The Node-RED `userDir/node_modules` install path is not writable by the user running Node-RED. Re-run `npm install` from a shell with the right ownership. |
| Browser request `/portal-react/css/<hash>.css` returns 404 | The portal's deploy hasn't produced a CSS bundle yet — open the editor, redeploy. If the URL is bookmarked from before a deploy, the hash is stale; reload the portal page itself. |
| WebSocket reconnects in an endless loop | Reverse-proxy is not forwarding `Upgrade: websocket` on `/fromcubes/<sub-path>/_ws`. Check the proxy config — nginx needs `proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade`, Traefik needs the `websocket` middleware. |
| `libs` packages fail to install on deploy | The user-installed npm packages declared in **Libs** install via Node-RED's `dynamicModuleList` mechanism, which needs network access from `userDir` and a writable `node_modules`. Behind a corporate proxy set `npm config set proxy …` for the Node-RED user. |
| Page loads but `data` stays `null` | Nothing has been pushed since the page connected — payloads are not cached server-side. Push periodically, or request initial state from the component (`send({}, "init")` → flow replies) |
| `user` is `null` even with Portal Auth on | Upstream proxy is not injecting `x-portal-user-*` headers |
| Page reloads on every deploy | Expected for code changes; clients soft-reconnect with exponential backoff |

## Architecture: source AND sink

The Node-RED guidelines suggest a node should "sit at the beginning, middle
or end of a flow — not all at once". `portal-react` intentionally violates
this: every node is both a **sink** (`msg → render`) and a **source** (UI
event → outbound `msg`). Trade-offs:

- **Pro**: one wire per portal is conceptually simpler — the same node owns
  the page lifecycle, its WebSocket, and the routing rules.
- **Con**: flow-error tracking only follows the `input → output` path.
  Errors originating in the browser (e.g. a runtime exception inside a UI
  handler) cross the WebSocket as a source-event and are **not** routed to
  a Catch node on the same tab — they surface as a red node status and a
  log line. This matches the Node-RED guidance for source nodes: "produces
  messages in response to external events".

If you need explicit Catch-node visibility for UI-originated errors, wire
the portal's output through a Switch / Catch chain — a UI event landing on
`msg.payload` is then a regular wire-level message that Catch can observe.

## Security

This module is meant to run behind a trusted Node-RED instance, ideally
behind a reverse proxy. Highlights:

- Admin write endpoints require the `Node-RED-API-Version` header (CSRF
  protection) and a `portal-react.write` permission when `adminAuth` is
  configured.
- Token-bucket rate-limit (default 60 burst / 1 req/s steady) on every
  write endpoint, tunable via `RED.settings.portalReact.rateLimit`.
- 1 MB JSON body cap, 100 MB asset-upload cap, 500 MB / 1000 files total
  assets quota, 1 MB WebSocket frame cap.
- `x-portal-user-*` identity headers are trusted unconditionally — production
  deployments **must** terminate auth at a reverse proxy that strips inbound
  identity headers before injecting verified ones.
